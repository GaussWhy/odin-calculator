# odin-calculator

In this project, I attempted to create an online calculator.  This project was extremely challenging in getting the mathematical operations to work properly.  For example, getting the addition part to work took me longer than I will admit, because at first the calculator would concatenate two numbers together, rather than add them.  

Another major struggle I had was adding the ability to support double/triple(and higher) digit numbers.  Because when I first got the calculations to work properly, they only worked if the user chose a single digit number.  

This project combined concepts I have learned in JavaScript, such as functions, if/else statements, and switch statements.  I decided not to make a separate script.js document because this project is one webpage.

In a perfect world, I would have enough time and skill to create the things promised in Version 2.0, but it is December 30th and I wanted to finish this by the end of the year.
